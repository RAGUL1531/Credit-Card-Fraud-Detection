# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud using logistic regression. The primary objective is to build a reliable model that can identify fraudulent transactions and help prevent financial losses.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and identifying patterns.

Model Training: Implementing logistic regression for binary classification.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Techniques like SMOTE and class weighting to address class imbalance.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
git clone https://github.com/RAGUL1531/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Preparation: Place your dataset in the data folder.

Run Preprocessing: Execute the preprocessing script to clean and transform the data.

bash
python preprocessing.py
Train Model: Run the training script to build and evaluate the logistic regression model.

bash
python train_model.py
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
